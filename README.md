## Code Review
* Your site looks awesome and fun and it’s so cool that you managed to do the whole project in React something we just started with
* Image in metatags did not show up for me or is not available, good to have since your site is very image-y ~
* Super nice and helpful having instructions and comments in your codes, it’s very organized in the folders, there are some images placed outside the “images” folder
* On the live view mobile (for me) seems to not be well responsive, same on Safari (it looks super neat on the other web browsers +)
* Fun hover effect on the buttons, made it more game-like, I like it a lot ~ 
* Fantastic job, the website looks soooo fun I really wanna play Mario now. The site feels a lot more alive with videos, images, animations and the colors, good job :D
